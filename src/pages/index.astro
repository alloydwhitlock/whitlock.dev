              Your CFO wants infrastructure costs down 30%. Your CTO needs reliability up.

            <p class="text-stone-600 leading-relaxed font-light mb-8">
              Most companies are in this bind: cut cloud spending while maintaining (or improving) performance. 
              The usual answer is "migrate to Kubernetes" or "buy another monitoring tool, making things worse.
            </p>
            <p class="text-stone-600 leading-relaxed font-light">
              I've spent a decade optimizing infrastructure at scale, from operating 10,000+ server Hadoop clusters 
              at LinkedIn to avoiding $1.5M in annual costs at CircleCI and cutting operational costs 30% at Scuba. 
              I find the waste, fix the bottlenecks, and make your existing tools actually work. I use AI extensively 
              to accelerate delivery, which means lower engagement costs for you.

              <p class="text-stone-900 text-lg font-light mb-3">
                Find 20-40% savings in your existing infrastructure
              </p>
              <p class="text-stone-600 leading-relaxed font-light">
                Most cloud waste comes from over-provisioning, idle resources, and inefficient architectures; not 
                from using the wrong vendor. I analyze actual utilization patterns, eliminate waste, and optimize 
                workload placement. Typical engagements find $200K-$2M+ in annual savings without migrations or downtime.
              </p>

              </p>
              <p class="text-stone-600 leading-relaxed font-light">
                Your developers shouldn't spend 40% of their time on infrastructure. I design self-service platforms 
                that give teams what they need without requiring deep DevOps knowledge. Focus on reducing cognitive 
                load, improving deployment velocity, and eliminating toil through automation that actually fits your workflow.
              </p>
            </div>

            <div>
              <h3 class="text-sm uppercase tracking-wider text-stone-500 mb-3 font-medium">Observability That Works</h3>
              <p class="text-stone-900 text-lg font-light mb-3">
                Stop paying $200K/year for monitoring that doesn't help you debug

              <p class="text-stone-600 leading-relaxed font-light">
                You have Datadog/New Relic/etc but incidents still take 4 hours to resolve. The problem isn't 
                the tool — it's what you're measuring and how it's instrumented. I've built custom observability 
                for Presto, Hadoop, and modern distributed systems. I'll make your existing tools useful or tell 
                you what actually needs to change.

                Operated infrastructure at 10,000+ servers at LinkedIn and led SRE teams at CircleCI. Reduced 
                operational toil by 40% through better automation and processes. I establish incident response 
                that works, implement SLOs that matter, and build systems that page less while running better.

                Fix rushed "vibe coded" projects that shipped fast but need real foundations
              </p>
              <p class="text-stone-600 leading-relaxed font-light">
                Startups ship fast with AI-generated code, then hit walls when scaling. I refactor AI-generated 
                or rapidly prototyped codebases into production-grade systems. I  
             use AI extensively to accelerate work, which means lower engagement costs for you while maintaining 
                quality and architectural rigor. You can't fix vibes without knowing how they're done!

              <p class="text-stone-600 leading-relaxed font-light">
                Built and scaled engineering orgs from scratch multiple times. At Scuba, grew from initial team to 
                25-person org across SRE, DevOps, and feature teams. At CircleCI, created the Security Engineering 
                team and scaled macOS infrastructure team. I establish processes that scale, implement effective 
                on-call rotations, create hiring frameworks, and mentor engineers without adding bureaucracy that 
                slows teams down.
